            The Eukaryote domain reflects a wide variety of organisms that all
            spanned from a common eukaryotic ancestor. Over 8 million eukaryotic
            species have risen since the branching of eukaryotes from archaea
            around 2 billion years ago. Despite billions of years of evolution,
            many proteins have been found to be well-conserved across many
            different eukaryotic lineages. The deep conservation of these
            proteins emphasizes the importance and ubiquitous nature of their
            roles in eukaryotes. CFMS (co-fractionation mass spectrometry) in
            turn outputs elution profiles for proteins. Using results from CFMS,
            we can predict which protein families are most similar to each other
            and are likely to form protein complexes that are conserved across
            different eukaryotic organisms. To this end, we used AlphaFold to
            predict the feasibility of possible predicted protein complexes
            across different eukaryote species.
