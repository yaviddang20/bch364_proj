              Complete workflow shown again. The first two steps have already
              been completed in previous experiments. We use the data from these
              experiments to predict potential eukaryotic protein complexes.

            CFMS results were gathered from previous experiments. CFMS was
            performed on 32 eukaryote species that span the major eukaryote
            clades. The elution profile for a single KOG group reflects 149
            different experiments, with several whole-proteome extractions and
            separations for most eukaryotic species chosen. The elution profiles
            are then clustered based on their similarity into multiple clusters
            of different hierarchy, with very similar to identical elution
            profiles being in the most exclusive clusters. KOG groups with
            not-so-similar elution profiles may be in the same clusters that are
            very broad and inclusive, but they would not be in the same clusters
            for clusters that are smaller and more exclusive.

            KOG groups in almost identical clusters were grouped together and
            predicted to be as part of a complex, as they have very similar
            elution profiles. In order to map the KOG groups to our eukaryotic
            organisms of interest, we first downloaded the organism proteomes
            from UniProt. These proteomes contain the sequences, gene ID, and
            the UniProt ID for each protein. The UniProt IDs were mapped to
            eggNOG’s KOG IDs and merged with the clustering data to obtain a new
            dataset. This new dataset contains the KOG groups that are predicted
            to form complexes. Each row of the new dataset now also contains the
            eukaryote of interest’s sequence and gene ID that corresponds to
            each KOG ID. Knowing the sequence for each KOG group for a certain
            eukaryote organism allows us to input the sequence into AlphaFold
            and the gene ID can identify which gene of the target eukaryote is
            predicted to form the complex.

              Subset of clustering data from the clustering csv file. Each
              cluster is assigned a number, with more inclusive clusters having
              lower numbers and more exclusive, smaller clusters having higher numbers. KOG groups
              with similar elution profiles are more likely to be in the same smaller clusters and have more identical cuts.

            AlphaFold has been shown to predict protein structures from
            sequences with high accuracy using computational prediction tools.
            While AlphaFold was originally intended to be used with monomers,
            some independent parties have developed tools to facilitate the use
            of AlphaFold for multimers. Here, AlphaFold Colab was used to
            predict the structure of protein complexes. Due to time and the
            sequence-length constraints of Colab, we have only put in a small
            subset of potential predicted dimers into AlphaFold.

              Tools used in this project: UniProt was used to gather proteome
              sequence data, eggNOG was used to acquire KOG IDs, DeepMind's
              Alphafold was used to predict protein structure based on sequence,
              and Colab was used to run AlphaFold.
